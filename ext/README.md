## Integrating Third Party Libraries

This directory contains all third party libraries that taproot depends on (excluding modm and its
dependencies). If you would like to add a new third-party library, you should add it as a
submodule in this directory. In particular, to integrate a library follow the following steps:

1. Add a new directory in the `ext/` directory. If the third party library is called `<cool-lib>`,
   call the directory `<cool-lib>-project`.
1. Add the third party library as a submodule in `<cool-lib>-project` (`git submodule add <sha>`).
1. Create a `module.lb` file in `<cool-lib>-project`. This will be used to copy files from the
   library upon code generation.
1. The `module.lb` file should look like the following. Replace `<cool-lib>` with the third party
   library and `<cool-file>` with the third party library file(s) to copy when generating software:
