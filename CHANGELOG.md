# Taproot Changelog

## November 2021

### Breaking changes

- The `sim-modm` directory in a generated Taproot instance has a new structure. Files are now in
  `sim-modm/hosted-TARGET/modm`, where `TARGET` is `linux`, `windows` or `darwin`. Make sure to
  delete and cleanly re-generate your Taproot instance, and update your SConstruct file as shown in
  the template project.
- Minor cleanup to the `RefSerial` object. Some fields in the `RefSerial` class now use
  `MODM_FLAGSX`. See [modm's
  documentation](https://modm.io/reference/module/modm-architecture-register/) for how these work.
  Structs and enum values previously stored directly inside the `RefSerial` object now must be
  prefixed by `Rx` or `Tx`.

### All changes

- "sim-modm" instance is now generated for all three major desktop platforms, with hardware builds
  and testing environments fully supported on each. (!73, #96, #15)
- Tests were added to the referee serial class. Minor logic/bug changes were made based on the
  tests.
- Robot-to-robot interaction handling was added to the `RefSerial` class. One can send a
  robot-to-robot message via `sendRobotToRobotMsg` and register a callback with the `RefSerial`
  object via `attachRobotToRobotMessageHandler`.
